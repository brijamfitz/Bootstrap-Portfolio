                <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. This is my first crack at web development, so I hope I'm off on the right
                    foot! A little about myself &mdash; my name is Brian, I'm 31 years old, grew up in a small town in central
                    Pennsylvania, and have been living in Philadelphia for the better part of the last 12 years. I have two
                    older brothers, a father originally from New York, and a mother originally from Vietnam. I don't have
                    any pets right now, but I want a little Shih Tzu someday!
                </p>

                <p>I'm excited to start this journey into the world of coding and web development. I've always had a strong
                    interest in computer science, but at the same time, was a bit intimidated by it all. I went to Temple
                    University, got a liberal arts degree, got a job, and have been toiling away ever since. I've been very
                    fortunate for all of those things, but have been yearning for something more. So I finally put those
                    fears to rest, and I'm ready to take on a new challenge in my life! That excitement definitely comes
                    with its share of anxiety, but I'm quickly learning that I have a deeper interest and eagerness than
                    I had anticipated. I hope that's a good sign!
                </p>
                <p>At the top of this page, you'll find a link to my portfolio, as well as an option to contact me with any
                    questions, comments, and feedback! Clicking on my name, or the
                    <strong>About</strong> link, will always bring you back to this page right here. I hope you enjoy my first website,
                    and many more to come!
                </p>
